### **UI/UX Documentation for `index.php`**

#### **1. Purpose**
The `index.php` file serves as the **landing page** for a love-themed chat application. It introduces users to the app's core features (e.g., chatting and exploring memories) and provides navigation options to access these features. The design emphasizes a romantic and modern aesthetic with animations, dark mode, and interactive elements.

#### **2. Key Features**
1. **Dark Mode Background**:
   - A gradient background (`#0a0a0a` to `#222222`) creates a sleek, immersive experience.
   - Enhances readability and aligns with the romantic theme.

2. **Heart Rain Animation**:
   - Small red hearts flow down the screen like rain, adding a dynamic and romantic touch.
   - Each heart has random size, speed, position, and opacity to simulate natural movement.

   - A spinning loader is displayed for 2 seconds when the page loads, creating a smooth entry experience.

4. **Text Animation**:
   - The title (`Welcome to Our Love World ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§`) and introduction text fade in smoothly, drawing attention to the content.
